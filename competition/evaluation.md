# Evaluation

**Negation detection** will be evaluated using the standard precision, recall and F1 scores as used in most published work: recall points are gained by correctly predicting that a negated entity is negated, precision points are obtained if a predicted negation is correct.

**Time expression recognition** will be evaluated using the standard precision, recall and F1 previously used for the entity-finding portion of SemEval 2018 Task 6.
